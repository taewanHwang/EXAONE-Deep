## Quickstart

- You need to install `transformers>=4.43.1` for the EXAONE Deep models. The latest version is recommended to use.

Here is the example code to show how to use EXAONE Deep models.

> [!Tip]
> In all the examples below, you can use another size model by changing 7.8B to 32B or 2.4B.

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, TextIteratorStreamer
from threading import Thread

model_name = "LGAI-EXAONE/EXAONE-Deep-7.8B"
streaming = True    # choose the streaming option

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    trust_remote_code=True,
    device_map="auto"
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "How many golf balls can fit in a school bus?"}
]
input_ids = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=True,
    add_generation_prompt=True,
    return_tensors="pt"
)

if streaming:
    streamer = TextIteratorStreamer(tokenizer)
    thread = Thread(target=model.generate, kwargs=dict(
        input_ids=input_ids.to("cuda"),
        eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,
        max_new_tokens=32768,
        do_sample=True,
        temperature=0.6,
        top_p=0.95,
        streamer=streamer
    ))
    thread.start()

    for text in streamer:
        print(text, end="", flush=True)
else:
    output = model.generate(
        input_ids.to("cuda"),
        eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,
        max_new_tokens=32768,
        do_sample=True,
        temperature=0.6,
        top_p=0.95,
    )
    print(tokenizer.decode(output[0]))
```

> [!Important]
> The EXAONE Deep models are trained with an optimized configuration,
> so we recommend following the [Usage Guideline](#usage-guideline) section to achieve optimal performance.

## Quantized Models

We introduce a series of quantized weights of EXAONE Deep models.

### AWQ

We provide AWQ-quantized weights of EXAONE Deep models, quantized using `AutoAWQ` library. Please refer to the [EXAONE Deep collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/LGAI-EXAONE/exaone-deep-67d119918816ec6efa79a4aa) for pre-quantized weights, and the [AutoAWQ documentation](https://github.com/casper-hansen/AutoAWQ) for more details.

You need to install the latest version of AutoAWQ library (`autoawq>=0.2.8`) to load the AWQ-quantized version of EXAONE Deep models.

```bash
pip install autoawq
```

You can load the model in similar ways to the original models, only changing the model name. It automatically loads with AWQ configuration of the model. Please check the [Quickstart section](#quickstart) above for more details.

### GGUF

We provide weights in `BF16` format and quantized weights in `Q8_0`, `Q6_K`, `Q5_K_M`, `Q4_K_M`, `IQ4_XS`. 

The example below is for the 7.8B model in BF16 format. Please refer to the [EXAONE Deep collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/LGAI-EXAONE/exaone-deep-67d119918816ec6efa79a4aa) to find quantized models. You may need to install `huggingface_hub` to download the GGUF weights.

```bash
# (optional) install huggingface_hub
pip install huggingface_hub

# Download the GGUF weights
huggingface-cli download LGAI-EXAONE/EXAONE-Deep-7.8B-GGUF \
    --include "EXAONE-Deep-7.8B-BF16*.gguf" \
    --local-dir .
```

## Run Locally

For end users, we introduce two ways to run EXAONE Deep models locally. 

> [!Note]
> We highly recommend to use repetition penalty not exceeding 1.0 for better generation quality.

### llama.cpp

You can run EXAONE models with llama.cpp as follows:

1. Install llama.cpp. Please refer to the [llama.cpp repository](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) for more details.

2. Download EXAONE Deep model in GGUF format.

```bash
huggingface-cli download LGAI-EXAONE/EXAONE-Deep-7.8B-GGUF \
    --include "EXAONE-Deep-7.8B-BF16*.gguf" \
    --local-dir .
```

3. Run the model with llama.cpp in conversational mode. We set chat-template explicitly to handle reasoning steps properly. 

```bash
llama-cli -m ./EXAONE-Deep-7.8B-BF16.gguf \
    -sys "" \
    -c 32768 \
    --temp 0.6 \
    --top-p 0.95 \
    --jinja \
    --chat-template "{% for message in messages %}{% if loop.first and message['role'] != 'system' %}{{ '[|system|][|endofturn|]\n' }}{% endif %}{% set content = message['content'] %}{% if '</thought>' in content %}{% set content = content.split('</thought>')[-1].lstrip('\\n') %}{% endif %}{{ '[|' + message['role'] + '|]' + content }}{% if not message['role'] == 'user' %}{{ '[|endofturn|]' }}{% endif %}{% if not loop.last %}{{ '\n' }}{% endif %}{% endfor %}{% if add_generation_prompt %}{{ '\n[|assistant|]<thought>\n' }}{% endif %}"
```

- In case of using EXAONE Deep 32B model with BF16 precision, you may need to download all split files and merge them before running the model.

    ```bash
    # Download all split files
    huggingface-cli download LGAI-EXAONE/EXAONE-Deep-32B-GGUF \
        --include "EXAONE-Deep-32B-BF16*.gguf" \
        --local-dir .

    # Merge all split files
    llama-gguf-split --merge \
        ./EXAONE-Deep-32B-BF16-00001-of-00002.gguf \
        ./EXAONE-Deep-32B-BF16.gguf
    ```

### Ollama

You can create and run EXAONE Deep models with GGUF format for customizing.

1. Install Ollama. Please refer to the [Ollama repository](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) for more details.

2. Download EXAONE Deep model in GGUF format. Please refer to the [GGUF section](#gguf) for more details.

3. Write the `Modelfile` for EXAONE Deep.

```text

#   because ollama does not support yet. We will update when according feature is available.
TEMPLATE """{{- range $i, $_ := .Messages }}
{{- $last := eq (len (slice $.Messages $i)) 1 -}}
{{ if eq .Role "system" }}[|system|]{{ .Content }}[|endofturn|]
{{ continue }}
{{ else if eq .Role "user" }}[|user|]{{ .Content }}
{{ else if eq .Role "assistant" }}[|assistant|]{{ .Content }}[|endofturn|]
{{ end }}
{{- if and (ne .Role "assistant") $last }}[|assistant|]<thought>
{{ end }}
{{- end -}}"""

# System prompt
SYSTEM """"""

# License
LICENSE """EXAONE AI Model License Agreement 1.1 - NC """
```

4. Convert the model to Ollama.
```bash
ollama create exaone -f Modelfile
```

        "messages": [
            {"role": "user", "content": "How many golf balls can fit in a school bus?"}
        ],
        "max_tokens": 30720,
        "temperature": 0.6,
        "top_p": 0.95,
    }'
```

<br>

## Usage Guideline

To achieve the expected performance, we recommend using the following configurations:

1. Ensure the model starts with `<thought>\n` for reasoning steps. The model's output quality may be degraded when you omit it. You can easily apply this feature by using `tokenizer.apply_chat_template()` with `add_generation_prompt=True`. Please check the example code on [Quickstart](#quickstart) section.
2. The reasoning steps of EXAONE Deep models enclosed by `<thought>\n...\n</thought>` usually have lots of tokens, so previous reasoning steps may be necessary to be removed in multi-turn situation. The provided tokenizer handles this automatically.
3. Avoid using system prompt, and build the instruction on the user prompt. 
4. Additional instructions help the models reason more deeply, so that the models generate better output.
    - For math problems, the instructions **"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}."** are helpful.
    - For more information on our evaluation setting including prompts, please refer to our [Documentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12524).
5. In our evaluation, we use `temperature=0.6` and `top_p=0.95` for generation. 
6. When evaluating the models, it is recommended to test multiple times to assess the expected performance accurately.

<br>

## Limitation

The EXAONE language model has certain limitations and may occasionally generate inappropriate responses. The language model generates responses based on the output probability of tokens, and it is determined during learning from training data. While we have made every effort to exclude personal, harmful, and biased information from the training data, some problematic content may still be included, potentially leading to undesirable responses. Please note that the text generated by EXAONE language model does not reflects the views of LG AI Research.

- Inappropriate answers may be generated, which contain personal, harmful or other inappropriate information.
- Biased responses may be generated, which are associated with age, gender, race, and so on.
- The generated responses rely heavily on statistics from the training data, which can result in the generation of
semantically or syntactically incorrect sentences.
- Since the model does not reflect the latest information, the responses may be false or contradictory.

LG AI Research strives to reduce potential risks that may arise from EXAONE language models. Users are not allowed
to engage in any malicious activities (e.g., keying in illegal information) that may induce the creation of inappropriate
outputs violating LG AI's ethical principles when using EXAONE language models.
